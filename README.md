# Covid-19-Analysis
WORK IN PROGRESS
Analysis of Public Covid-19 Data from ECDC, sourced from OWID https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data

This project consists of two analyses:
1. Investigation into the relationships between Covid-19 testing and cases/deaths performed in the Winter of 2020
2. Investigation into the relationship between Covid-19 vaccines and new cases of Covid-19 performed in the Spring of 2021

A majority of this analysis was performed in R, while some operations were performed using Excel where appropriate.

The following R libraries were used in support of these analyses:
